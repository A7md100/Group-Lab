Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This project aims to implement a simple two-player game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using algorithms and conditional logic. The game is played over a series of rounds,
where each player chooses one of three possible hand gestures: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of each round is determined based on a set of rules,
and the first player to win a set number of rounds is declared the winner of the game.
The project includes a main game function that handles the game's logic and supporting roles for prompting user input, comparing player choices, and updating the score.
The game can be played in the command line interface by running the main part.
The project is intended to be a simple demonstration of how conditional logic can be used to implement game rules and can be extended or modified to include
additional features or game modes.

The app will allow two players to play the game and keep track of the score for any rounds. The scope of the project includes the following:
- Creating a user interface that is intuitive and easy to use
- Developing the game logic to ensure that it follows the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Writing code that is well-organized, efficient, and easy to maintain
- Testing the code thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the quality standards
- Coordinating releases and updates as needed to ensure timely delivery to customers
